                <p>
                    Custom Artist creates opportunities for artists to get in touch with clients. These clients could be companies or private clients who are looking for an artist to create a particular form of artwork.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The client uploads an assignment. Artists respond to assignments they’re interested in with an artwork proposal. Through a logical and clear step-by-step process the artist and client can come to an agreement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Custom Artist supports artists who are struggling to find assignments to earn money. At the same time it saves companies and private clients time to find the art they are – in whatever form – looking for.
